- 👋 Hi, I’m @Damien3008
- 👀 I’m interested in space exploration and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my first year in engineering school IPSA Toulouse (France) highly specialized in aerospace and aerodynamics fields. During my studies I oriented myself within the aerospace systems major because of my strong attraction for programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding in Python or C++ in order to enhance my skills in programming.
