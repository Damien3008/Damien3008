# Hi, Iâ€™m Damien MARTINS GOMES

<center>
As a research student at the University of Concordia in Montreal, I am delving into Deep Learning and Computer Vision. This master's is part of a double diploma program with my engineering school in Toulouse, France, where I focus on aerospace telecommunications systems. Fusing aerospace and computer science has been thrilling, and I'm passionate about leveraging AI to shape the future of aerospace telecommunications. #ResearchStudent #DeepLearning #ComputerVision #AerospaceTelecommunications #AIinAerospace #Collaboration
